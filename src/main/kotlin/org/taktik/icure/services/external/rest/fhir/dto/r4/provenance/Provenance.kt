/**
 * Who, What, When for a set of resources
 *
 * Provenance of a resource is a record that describes entities and processes involved in producing
 * and delivering or otherwise influencing that resource. Provenance provides a critical foundation for
 * assessing authenticity, enabling trust, and allowing reproducibility. Provenance assertions are a
 * form of contextual metadata and can themselves become important records with their own provenance.
 * Provenance statement indicates clinical significance in terms of confidence in authenticity,
 * reliability, and trustworthiness, integrity, and stage in lifecycle (e.g. Document Completion - has
 * the artifact been legally authenticated), all of which may impact security, privacy, and trust
 * policies.
